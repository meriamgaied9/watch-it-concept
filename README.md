# Watch-IT concept
The Starter Pack presents its concept for a space wearable gadget...

# Explanation

Advanced electronics are a problem in space due to the density of the chips. 

The more circuitry in smaller electronic components, 
the greater the susceptibility to cosmic radiation. 

The best solution is radiation-hardened processers that are not affected 
by fluctuations in radiation levels to bring space-usable tech up to par with cool Earth tech.

Wearable helps astronauts onboard the International Space Station . 
It monitors heart rate and breathing patterns, and collects data to investigate whether 
changes in heart activity are related to a problem, such as poor sleep quality. 

Fabrics can be infused with technology to provide perspective on multiple investigations, 
such as respiration, body acceleration, skin temperature, and more...


Based on an already existing vest mesuring heart rate and breathing patterns during sleep, 
we decided to design an additional accessory that will provide the astronaut with a full check 
up and  updates of health status.

This smart watch will be equipped with several sensors that will provide detailed health status 
and connect it with the vest as well as the ISS data base to permit immediate help in case of emergency.

Along this watch you will find the concept of a complementary app for direct access to the data base.
The app will connect the device with the network and keep the astronaut updated and well informed of 
the current environmental situation. 

In addition, the device will be equiped with NFC to read out all information from an NFC Tag fixed to each ISS onboard system in case for a problem fix.

It is also connected to the userâ€™s medical files, records their vitals and reports any abrupt change 
signalled by either the vest or the watch to provide immediate help.

Via this app and watch it will be easier to connect to the data base , keeping up with ones vitals, 
updates and emergency report even when the astronaut is sleeping or unconscious.
